Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, we’re diving into a groundbreaking piece of technology that’s shaping the future of artificial intelligence and machine learning: Google’s Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs.

TPUs are specialized processors designed specifically to accelerate the complex computations required by neural networks. Unlike general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, TPUs are tailored for a single purpose: making machine learning tasks faster, more efficient, and cost-effective.

The story of TPUs began in 2013 when Google faced an enormous computational challenge. The increasing demand for machine learning in applications like Google Search, Translate, and Photos meant traditional processors couldn’t keep up without drastically expanding data center capacity. The solution? A domain-specific processor optimized for neural network inference. In just 15 months, Google designed, built, and deployed the TPU, a feat of engineering that now powers some of the world’s most advanced AI systems.

What makes TPUs so remarkable is their ability to deliver up to 30 times the performance and 80 times the performance-per-watt of contemporary GPUs and CPUs, all while being simpler and more cost-effective. They achieve this by focusing on efficient matrix multiplication, using 8-bit integer arithmetic, and integrating a massive number of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units.

In this presentation, we’ll explore the key features of TPU architecture, their impact on modern AI applications, and the lessons they offer for computer organization and processor design. Let’s begin by understanding the foundational problem TPUs were built to solve.
