# Topics of interest
This is a  comprehensive list of topics covered in CSC 411. The idea is that during our research, we will fill in information under the topics that we come across as they relate to TPUs.
The purpose of this document is to show, as much as we possibly can, how our understanding of TPUs also shows a complete understanding of material covered in CSC 411.
